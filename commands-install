Commands will not function if not restarted.
To restart, close this terminal window and open a new window.
Commands created are: 'pi-ware-install', 'pi-ware-uninstall', 'pi-ware-update', 'pi-ware-apps'.
'pi-ware-install' installs the program,
'pi-ware-uninstall' uninstalls the program and
'pi-ware-update' updates pi-ware. (Usually not required unless a force update has to be done. Automatic updates will update pi-ware. This command can also be used to make you feel happy that pi-ware is up-to-date (^äºº^).)
'pi-ware-apps' shows the current app available on pi-ware.
Thanks for using pi-ware."
